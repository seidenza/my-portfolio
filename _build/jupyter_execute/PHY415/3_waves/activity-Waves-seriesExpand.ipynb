    "We found that it was possible to use the Fourier transform to decompose the signal into its constituent frequencies. Later we will use this idea to build up the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (FFT) algorithm. For now, we will write everything out in full to mirror our analytical work.\n",

    "You might be wondering why we do this kind of deconstruction and what it is used for. It turns out that for many systems this kind of analysis tells you how energy, momentum, and other quantities might be distributed in the system. For example, the analogy to a complex quantum mechanical system might be the various occupied energy states of the system. The known frequencies could correspond to the energy levels of the system. The Fourier coefficients tell you how much of the system is in each energy state. There are many such analogies in physics; and many such transformations in multiple dimensions to extract this information. Fourier is just one of the most common.\n",

But these will start from the expected coefficients and ask you to find the signal. This is the reverse of what we have done so far. With your code you should be able to play and adjust the signal to match the coefficients qualitatively.\n",
