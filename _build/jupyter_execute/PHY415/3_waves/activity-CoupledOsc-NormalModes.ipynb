    "# 17 Oct 23 - Activity: Normal Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "As we begin to work with multi-particle systems, we begin to open the number of degrees of freedom of the system. We increase the complexity of it and the challenge of modeling it. We will increasingly need tools that help us take less tractable issues and make them palatable. One such tool that forms the basis of many others is **Normal Modes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal modes are ways of breaking up our understanding of a system into discrete (potentially infinite and hopefully vanishingly small) pieces. This lets us get at the big picture of the system and characterize how much we are neglecting. The concept of normal modes underlies much of the analysis done in quantum mechanics, field theory, fluid mechanics, and signal processing. In fact, numerical routines often make use of forms of these modes to do economize calculations -- *especially when we move beyond a few hundred bodies in the system*. This stuff is part and parcel of most research in physics. For example, how we understand the [Cosmic Background Radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_background_radiation) relies on a [normal mode like analysis](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-ancient-light-reveals-the-universes-contents-20200128/).\n"

    "#### Method 1: Assume a Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal mode solution is one in which all parts of a system oscillate with the same frequency. For linear systems, this can be a very useful approach because any solution can be represented as a linear combination of normal modes. In general,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = \\sum_n c_n \\psi_n(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f(t)$ is the solution, $c_n$ are constants, and $\\psi_n(t)$ are the normal modes. This kind of normal mode analysis forms the basis for signal analysis, image processing, and many other fields. For non-linear systems, we lose superposition and thus, we lose out ability to employ normal modes. However, near equilibria and in other limits, normal modes are still used. We will start by assuming a normal mode solution for both masses and plug that into our equations of motion. \n",

    "Assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_1(t) = A_1\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi_1)$$\n",

We made a chose for the form of the solution. Other forms are acceptable as long as they have two free parameters; it's a second order differential equation.\n",
