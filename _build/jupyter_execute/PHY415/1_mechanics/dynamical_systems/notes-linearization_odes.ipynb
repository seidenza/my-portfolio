    "# 19 Sep 23 - Notes: Heading towards Chaos\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the principal motivations for our work thus far has been to get to analyze systems that show suprising and complex behavior. In mechanics, you might have heard of those kinds of behviors as chaotic or exhibiting chaos. It turns out the chaos is a specific kind of behavior that we can find. To motivate us, let's remind ourselves of how cool nature can be.\n",

You'll find some simple relationship between $x$ and $y$. Any scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector so we usually just choose the simplest one. Say if you found that $x = -y$. Then for a nice clean looking eigenvector you could choose $\\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$. \n",
