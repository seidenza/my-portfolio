    "## Azimuthally Symmetric Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, azimuthally symmetric solutions, the electric potential is independent of $\\phi$ and the solutions are of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(r,\\theta) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{l=0}^\\infty \\left(A_{nl} r^n + \\frac{B_{nl}}{r^{n+1}}\\right) P_l(\\cos\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P_l(\\cos\\theta)$ are the [Legendre polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_polynomials). The coefficients $A_{nl}$ and $B_{nl}$ are determined by the boundary conditions. We will practice solving for these coefficients in this activity."
