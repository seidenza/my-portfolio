    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{r}'_i$ is the location of the charge relative to the origin, and $\\mathbf{r}$ is the location of the field point relative to the origin. This **net electric field** is the result of the **superposition** of the electric fields from each charge. But here the charges are discrete, we can identify each charge uniquely in terms of it's charge and location. This concept can be abstracted to a continuous distribution of charge, where we can identify the charge at any point in space by the charge density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. In this case, the charge is not a point charge, but rather a small chunk of charge that we model as a point charge. That is, we can write the electric field contributed by that chunk $dq$ as:\n",

    "This gives a general prescription for finding the electric field in most situations (i.e., where the integral converges). But this appraoch is only analytically tractable in situations where we are able to find anti-derivatives of the integrands that we construct. There are many, many techniques to evaluating tricky integrals. But in the end, we often turn to technologies like Mathematica, [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/), or [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) to do the heavy lifting for us. Numerical methods are also very useful, and we already used a solver for 2D problems."

It can only be computed directly if we can form integrals that we can perform analytically. Otherwise it can form the basis for other approaches. Typically, we use the Biot-Savart Law to compute the magnetic field for a steady current and for geometries that have a high degree of symmetry. The most common case is a thin wire with a steady, constant current $I$. Then the full form simplifies to the line integral:\n",
