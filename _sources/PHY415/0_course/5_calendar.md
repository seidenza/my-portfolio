# Calendar

In this course, we will cover four principal topics in physics (in this order):

1. Classical Mechanics and Ordinary Differential Equations
2. Electromagnetism and Partial Differential Equations
3. Waves and Fourier Analysis
4. Statistical Mechanics and Monte Carlo models

The class is roughly broken into equal parts for each section. Below we indicate how each week will be spent. This is subject to change based on your input and feedback. But roughly you can expect the following:
